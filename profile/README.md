### 1. [What is Team Ruthenium?]

Alright, moving on to Team Ruthenium. What’s that? It’s my little squad of devs. We’re all pretty much noobs, but we out here trying to make something happen anyway. Here’s the breakdown of the team:

- Japanese (and me) – 12%  
- American – 35%  
- Other – 53%

Yeah, we’re a mixed bunch from all over, but that’s what makes it fun, right? Anyway, that’s all there is to know about the team for now.


### 2. [what is 80 FUCKERS?]

80Fuckers? Lemme break it down for ya—it's a straight-up dumpster fire of brain-dead idiots. A gang of absolute goofy ahh who can’t get their shit together. Bunch of fuckin’ morons rollin’ around like they own the place, but nah, they’re just a whole lotta nothin’.
